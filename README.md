Hi!
I'm Stacey Adams, a wife and mother of two incredible sons, as well as two spoiled fur babies. 
I’m a 13-year Army veteran and a ASU alum, where I earned my BS in Computer Information Systems in 2014. 
Currently, I serve as the Director of Operations at a local medical clinic.
I live in Guntersville, AL, where I was raised and attended high school. 
I chose ASU for my graduate studies in Cybersecurity since I am an alumni. 
I am aiming to complete my MS by Spring 2026. Although I’m not yet working in the cybersecurity field, I’m eager to dive in and expand my knowledge. 
Ohhh…..War Eagle!
